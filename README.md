# baastiMod

This is a mod for (currently only) Forge 1.16.1 - 1.16.5<br>
It is conceptualized by [baastiZockt](https://www.youtube.com/c/baastiZockt/) and written by him and myself (the guy who wrote this file), Cheos.

## Languages / Sprachen

As [baastiZockt](https://www.youtube.com/c/baastiZockt/) has a community of mostly German-speaking people, there is also a German version of this file [here](README_GERMAN.md).<br>
Da [baastiZockt](https://www.youtube.com/c/baastiZockt/) ja eine Community hat, die größtenteils aus deutssprachigen Leuten besteht, gibt es auch eine deutsche Version dieser Datei [hier](README_GERMAN.md).

## Downloads?

Yeah. Over on [Curseforge](https://well.i.didnt.actually/create/a/curseforge-project/yet)

## What can I do with the mod?

Well... this mod is very likely to become a quite random assortment of features.
Current featues include:
* The 'Undying' enchantment

## I found a bug.

Report it! There's nothing that'll stop you from doing that, right?
No, really. We're really happy for every bug report, because really... wo want's a bugged mod?
